\mainsection{Changes}

This is v1.1 of the Rust-based implementation system
for SCALE.

\subsection{Current Known Bugs}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Operator arithmetic operations for  \verb|ClearInteger<K>| and \verb|SecretInteger<K>|.
\item Functions with multiple return values can cause a problem for the compiler, especially
when they are not-inlined. Thus avoid these. If you get weird behaviour this might
be the reason.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changes in version 1.1 from 1.0}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Some functions which should have been {\bf unsafe} are now marked as {\bf unsafe}.
\item Added documentation of some functions related to bit processing.
\item Added in comparison member functions for the \verb|ClearInteger<K>| type.
\item Fixed some arithmetic bugs in \verb|ClearInteger<K>| and \verb|SecretInteger<K>| types.
\item Round complexity between Rust pipeline and the old Mamba pipeline is the same now for some test benchmarking functions.
\item The \verb|ClearIEEE| class can now process arithmetic operations
	as well as having a full math library, which is relatively fast.
	Thus the \verb|ClearIEEE| type should be preferred for all
	{\em clear} operations on floating point values.
\item A full math library for \verb|SecretIEEE| is implemented.
\item The crate for \verb|ClearIEEE| and \verb|SecretIEEE| is now
	called simply \verb|scale_std::ieee|
\item Added fixed point operations with new data types
\verb|ClearFixed<K,F>| and \verb|SecretFixed<K,F>|.
Note, the \verb|SecretFixed<K,F>| is generally much faster than 
the \verb|SecretIEEE| type.
\item Conversion between \verb|ClearFixed<K,F>| and \verb|ClearIEEE|
	is possible by means of the respective \verb|from| functions.
\item Arrays/Slices can now be created for the datatypes
	\verb|ClearIEEE|,  \verb|SecretIEEE|, \verb|ClearFixed<K,F>| and \verb|SecretFixed<K,F>|.
\item Memory management is now dynamic and done via the SCALE runtime, thus the need to define memory size at the start of a SCALE Rust program has gone.
\item \verb|Array| and \verb|Slice| are now more robust and closer to what the standard
        Rust \verb|Vec| type does.
	Note use of \verb|get| on an \verb|Array| and \verb|Slice| costs at runtime
	so use  \verb|get_unchecked| where possible.
\end{enumerate}
